# Titanic Survival Predictor

This project is part of my AI learning journey, where I build progressively complex machine learning projects. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical data and machine learning.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predict survival (`0` = No, `1` = Yes) using features such as:
- Passenger class
- Gender
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Port of embarkation

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to load and explore tabular data with `pandas`
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Visualizing data distributions and patterns
- Training a logistic regression model
- Evaluating classification results

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
